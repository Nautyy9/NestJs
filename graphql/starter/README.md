`ts-morph`: This package is a TypeScript AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) manipulation library. It allows
you to programmatically analyze, modify, and generate TypeScript code. It can be particularly useful
when working with code generation or refactoring tools, such as generating TypeScript types from
GraphQL schemas or modifying existing TypeScript files programmatically.
